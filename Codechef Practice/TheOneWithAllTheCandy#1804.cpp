// There are N neighbours. The ith neigbhour has initial energy equal to Aiâ€‹. There is one bowl filled with chocolates. 
// The neighbours are made to stand in a row and the bowl is passed around by obeying the following rules:

// Any person can hold the bowl initially.
// If the person holding the bowl has positive energy, he/she passes the bowl to the person on the immediate right of him/her. 
// The rightmost person in the row passes the bowl to the leftmost person in the row.
// The act of passing the bowl takes 1 second.
// If the person holding the bowl has non-positive energy, he/she drops the bowl.
// After each pass, the energy of the person reduces by 1.

// Among all possible ways in which the N neighbours start the game, find the maximum time until the bowl is dropped.
