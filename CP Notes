# Always read the problem statement properly and go through the given test cases
# and its explanation to find the necessary and hidden details/hints required to solve the problem.

# x % (lcm(x,y)) = y % (lcm(x,y)) = 0

# (x + y) % z = (x%z + y%z) %z

# Sequence of 2 letters (eg. a,b) aababb will have maxiumum palindrome substring size 3
# Eg. aababbaababbaababbaababb...so on has maxmimum length of substring = 3  

# If you have to find the combination of some sort for elements in a vector ( eg. difference between the two elements without repition)
# Eg. if vector contains (x1,x2,x3,x4...ans so on),
# To find: abs(x1-x2) + abs(x1-x3) + abs(x1-x4) + abs(x2-x3) + abs(x2-x4) + abs(x3-x4)
# Sort the vector in decreasing order to get elements as (y1,y2,y3,y4...and so on), n numbers(say)
# Then req. ans = n-1*y1 + (n-1-2)*y2 + (n-1-4)*y3 + (n-1-6)*y4... ans so on.

# Whenever you see 2^(x) in constrain, it's probably the question of binary search, so think of the solution using binary search.
